# Dwarf Fortress Launcher To Do

## Features

-   Choose which configs are "basic"
-   Manage multiple versions
-   Hide/quit launcher when DF is launched, show/reopen when it quits (as an option)

## Fixes

-   Handle font/tileset/backup names being too long (currently its a mess)
-   Get rid of the directory selection
-   Fix font/tileset selection after adding one
-   Selected save isn't the save used

## Ideas

## Other

-   **Conform to standard.js**
-   Split `main.js` into multiple files (e.g. Menu, fonts + tilesets, functions)?
-   Update to the newest version of Electron (1.6.5 right now)
-   Work on opening text readability
-   Reorganize the source file layout (with a src dir)
-   Use Stylus instead of CSS
-   Unify CSS (Stylus) to one file?
-   Prevent modification of settings before download DF
-   Making backup archive paths relative to DF
